a website to play 'TicTacToe' game.
learning 'building the house from inside out' from https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out.
the key point is making the code decoupled, build 'the frame of the house' first, then the UI.
'the beauty of of decoupled code is that changing the implementation of any of the sub-modules will not require us to rewrite the whole programe'
the concept of 'closure' is important and is wildely used in this project.
I will try to create a Pseudo AI as a game opponent.
